					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

&quot;These datasets, starting with school gardens, but expanding to school environments in general would be helpful in potentially determining whether there was a correlation between the quality of education, wealth, and the quality of the school environment.&quot;

Correlation between SAT test and wealth of neighborhood: http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/10/07/sat-scores-and-income-inequality-how-wealthier-kids-rank-higher/

Correlation between wealth of neighborhood and urban trees: http://persquaremile.com/2012/05/24/income-inequality-seen-from-space/ (original paper: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607002174)

Quality of education is hard to define. Is it measured by SAT score or overall success of the former students? Even through this lens, research shows that inherited wealth is the most important factor to economic success and education attainment: http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/social-mobility-memos/posts/2014/11/12-neighborhood-effect-upward-mobility-rothwell

So a few interesting questions might be: do Boston schools fit into this national narrative? Or is Boston an outlier? If Boston schools are outliers, is it because they&#039;re schools, or is it a specificity of the city?
