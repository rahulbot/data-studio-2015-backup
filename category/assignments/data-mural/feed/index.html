				<description><![CDATA[The process we used to create the data mural was definitely different from the design meetings I attend weekly on visualization projectsÂ in my research. Most projects that we visualize are more data heavy and less illustrative because the points we want to include in particular visualizations often dictated the visual forms and complexity we needed to represent. I think that there is a tendency to focus on the quantity and quality of data in my &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/26/data-mural/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">data mural</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[While I have prior experience designing data-driven stories, creating the Food For Free data mural was dramatically different from the design processes I was used to. As laid out in the Data Journalism Handbook, my typical process involves querying a data set to answer specific questions or identify outliers andÂ interesting patterns. Brainstorming for the mural felt a lot less structured, more akin toÂ the &#8220;blue sky&#8221; ideation of early stage product design (what I like to &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/26/painting-with-data/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Painting with Data</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[I found our story finding and visual design process fun and surprisingly similar toÂ processes that I have used before for design brainstorming &#8211; I guess theres a reason such sticky note techniques are widely used by designers ðŸ™‚ Last semester I took a class called Engineering Innovation and Design. As a brainstorming exercise for our final project, we were told to get into groups, grab a bunch of sticky notes, and then write down the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/24/design-process-2/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Design Process</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[As a former photography editor for The Tech, part of my job included taking a series of photos from differentÂ event, whether it be a campus performance or a demonstration in Harvard Square, and turning it into a story that makes sense to the general audience. Most events tendÂ to be summed up into just one picture, though there are other instances where multipleÂ photos from the event are run asÂ a &#8220;photo spread&#8221;.

				<description><![CDATA[I found the mural design process of our class very different from my previous design processes. Â First, let me briefly lay out our mural design process: Introduction to the organization (Food For Free) through the voice of the director Group discussion to find a story based on the follow criteria: importance: impact on the audience relevance: relevant to the organization and to us accuracy: how well-supported by data Summarize the story into a sentence.

				<description><![CDATA[Instead of starting directly with data, we began our data story for the Food For Free mural by listening to a verbal narrative of the organizationâ€™s history and impact from one of its leaders. We heard about Food For Freeâ€™s beginnings, its expansion throughout the greater-Boston area, and its plans for the future. After hearing the story, we were presented with data, some of which was on a global level, some on a local level. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/24/developing-a-data-story/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Developing a Data Story</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Recently, our class worked to conceptualize our data mural for the organization Food For Free. I was absent for the last class, in which we carried out most of our visual designing of the mural, so I will focus instead on the processes carried out during the previous class. In this class session, the executive director of Food For Free visited our class to discuss the organization, its purpose, its functions, and its future goals. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/24/food-for-free-finding-the-story/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Food for Free: Finding the Story</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With the topic of food security in mind and the Food for Free organization as our focus, our class set out to tell a story using national and local data, as well as data specific to Food for Free. From these numbers, we were to eventually paint a mural. How were we to turn these facts and figures into something more digestible and visually appealing, while also creating impact?

				<description><![CDATA[To create our data mural about Food For Free, we stayed close to the principle of starting with data and finishing with a story. We began by gathering information from Executive Director Sasha Purpura, who spoke about the organization&#8217;s history and goals. We then looked at data about Food For Free&#8217;s reach, as well as statistics about food security in the United States. Guided by Rahul&#8217;s taxonomy of data stories, we came up with multiple &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2015.datatherapy.org/2015/02/24/finding-our-story-for-food-for-free/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Finding our story for Food for Free</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Our project for FOOD FOR FREE started with identifying a possible story based of the dataset provided by the association. Not only the data was backed up by a short presentation by their director, which gave a helpful insight and personal experience as well as stressing out some key elements of their story. As stated in the Segel &#38; Heer reading, traditional narrative visualizations are usually based out of the data itself.
